Robotic systems are considered as agents, possessing a manipulator and acting with objects in a determined external environment. The MultiMAP planning algorithm proposed in the article is hierarchical. It is iterative and based on the original sign representation of knowledge about objects and processes, agents knowledge about themselfs and about other members of the group. For distribution actions between agents in general plan signs “I” and “Other” (“They”) are used. In conclusion, the results of experiments in the model problem “Blocksworld” for a group of several agents are presented.},

	abstract = {Behavior planning is an important function of any complex technical facility intelligent control system. Presently, a symbol paradigm of artificial intelligence offers a variety of planning algorithms, including those that use precedent information, i.e. algorithms based on acquired knowledge. A symbol grounding problem within the exiting approaches of knowledge representation does not allow effective use the developed algorithms together with learning mechanisms for the purpose of solving a wide variety of applied problems by actual intelligent agents (robotics systems). This article presents the original planning algorithm (MAP Planner), which uses a sign world model as the basis for acquisition and maintenance of knowledge for future use in behavior planning. the sign problem approach describes planning as a cognitive function actualized by the world model of a subject of activity. Apart from solving symbol grounding problems and ensuring psychological and biological plausibility, a sign planning process model allows interaction of an intelligent agent with other participants in solving a cooperative task. The article presents the description of the knowledge representation method used, a MAP planning algorithm, and a model experiment in a “block world”.},

	abstract = {Behavior planning is known to be one of the basic cognitive functions, which is essential for any cognitive architecture of any control system used in robotics. At the same time most of the widespread planning algorithms employed in those systems are developed using only approaches and models of Artificial Intelligence and don't take into account numerous results of cognitive experiments. As a result, there is a strong need for novel methods of behavior planning suitable for modern cognitive architectures aimed at robot control. One such method is presented in this work and is studied within a special class of navigation task called smart relocation task. The method is based on the hierarchical two-level model of abstraction and knowledge representation, e.g. symbolic and subsymbolic. On the symbolic level sign world model is used for knowledge representation and hierarchical planning algorithm, MAP, is utilized for planning. On the subsymbolic level the task of path planning is considered and solved as a graph search problem. Interaction between both planners is examined and inter-level interfaces and feedback loops are described. Preliminary experimental results are presented.},

	abstract = {Extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in recent years has induced the rapid growth of research areas related to UAV production. Among these, the design of control systems capable of automating a wide range of UAV activities is one of the most actively explored and evolving. Currently, researchers and developers are interested in designing control systems that can be referred to as intelligent, e.g. the systems which are suited to solve such tasks as planning, goal prioritization, coalition formation etc. and thus guarantee high levels of UAV autonomy. One of the principal problems in intelligent control system design is tying together various methods and models traditionally used in robotics and aimed at solving such tasks as dynamics modelling, control signal genera- tion, location and mapping, path planning etc. with the methods of behaviour modelling and planning which are thoroughly studied in cognitive science. Our work is aimed at solving this problem. We propose layered architecture — STRL (strategic, tactical, reactive, layered) — of the control system that au- tomates the behaviour generation using a cognitive approach while taking into account complex dynamics and kinematics of the control object (UAV).We use a special type of knowledge representation — sign world model — that is based on the psychological activity theory to describe individual behaviour planning and coalition formation processes. We also propose path planning methodology which serves as the mediator between the high-level cognitive activities and the reactive control signals generation. To generate these signals we use a state-dependent Riccati equation and specific method for solving it. We believe that utilization of the proposed architecture will broaden the spectrum of tasks which can be solved by the UAV's coalition automatically, as well as raise the autonomy level of each individual member of that coalition.},

	abstract = {In this paper we outline the approach of solving special type of navigation tasks for robotic systems, when a coalition of robots (agents) acts in the 2D environment, which can be modified by the actions, and share the same goal location. The latter is originally unreachable for some members of the coalition, but the common task still can be accomplished as the agents can assist each other (e.g. by modifying the environment). We call such tasks smart relocation tasks (as the can not be solved by pure path planning methods) and study spatial and behavior interaction of robots while solving them. We use cognitive approach and introduce semiotic knowledge representation — sign world model which underlines behavioral planning methodology. Planning is viewed as a recursive search process in the hierarchical state-space induced by sings with path planning signs reside on the lowest level. Reaching this level triggers path planning which is accomplished by state of the art grid-based planners focused on producing smooth paths (e.g. LIAN) and thus indirectly guarantying feasibility of that paths against agent's dynamic constraints.},

	abstract = {Functions that are referred in psychology as functions of consciousness are considered. These functions include reflection, consciousness of activity motivation, goal setting, synthesis of goal oriented behavior, and some others. The description is based on the concept of sign, which is widely used in psychology and, in particular, in the cultural-historical theory by Vygotsky, in which sign is interpreted informally. In this paper, we elaborate upon the concept of sign, consider mechanisms of sign formation, and some self-organization on the set of signs. Due to the work of self-organization mechanisms, a new method for the representation of the world model of an actor appears. The concept of semiotic network is introduced that is used for the examination of the actor's world models. Models of some functions indicated above are constructed. The second part of the paper is devoted to functions of self-consciousness and to the application of the constructed models for designing plans and constructing new architectures of intelligent agents that are able, in particular, to distribute roles in coalitions.},
