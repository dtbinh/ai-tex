abstract = {A technique for retrieving causal connections of binary relationships from a set of fact bases is suggested. The fact bases are formed for the target properties of each class of objects. The class descriptions are formed by habituation on data from a loosely formalized object domain. The habituation is organized using a co-evolutional genetic algorithm that reduces the initial feature space. The cause?and?effect relationships for all target properties are sought by the formed optimized class descriptions using stage one of the DSM method. The suggested technique is suitable for the analysis of the full data in small amounts and large incomplete data arrays. Several model experiments using the MIMIC II medical database were conducted.},

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) vaccination is a promising way to contend cancer metastases especially in the case of immunogenic tumors. Unfortunately, it is only rarely possible to achieve a satisfactory clinical outcome in the majority of patients treated with a particular DC vaccine. Apparently, DC vaccination can be successful with certain combinations of features of the tumor and patients immune system that are not yet fully revealed. Difficulty in predicting the results of the therapy and high price of preparation of individual vaccines prevent wider use of DC vaccines in medical practice. Here we propose an approach aimed to uncover correlation between the effectiveness of specific DC vaccine types and personal characteristics of patients to increase efficiency of cancer treatment and reduce prices. To accomplish this, we suggest two-step analysis of published clinical trials results for DCs vaccines: first, the information extraction subsystem is trained, and, second, the extracted data is analyzed using JSM and AQ methodology.},

abstract = {In this paper we outline the approach of solving special type of navigation tasks for robotic systems, when a coalition of robots (agents) acts in the 2D environment, which can be modified by the actions, and share the same goal location. The latter is originally unreachable for some members of the coalition, but the common task still can be accomplished as the agents can assist each other (e.g. by modifying the environment). We call such tasks smart relocation tasks (as the can not be solved by pure path planning methods) and study spatial and behavior interaction of robots while solving them. We use cognitive approach and introduce semiotic knowledge representation — sign world model which underlines behavioral planning methodology. Planning is viewed as a recursive search process in the hierarchical state-space induced by sings with path planning signs reside on the lowest level. Reaching this level triggers path planning which is accomplished by state of the art grid-based planners focused on producing smooth paths (e.g. LIAN) and thus indirectly guarantying feasibility of that paths against agent’s dynamic constraints.},

abstract = {Functions that are referred in psychology as functions of consciousness are considered. These functions include reflection, consciousness of activity motivation, goal setting, synthesis of goal oriented behavior, and some others. The description is based on the concept of sign, which is widely used in psychology and, in particular, in the cultural–historical theory by Vygotsky, in which sign is interpreted informally. In this paper, we elaborate upon the concept of sign, consider mechanisms of sign formation, and some self?organization on the set of signs. Due to the work of self?organization mechanisms, a new method for the representation of the world model of an actor appears. The concept of semiotic network is introduced that is used for the examination of the actor’s world models. Models of some functions indicated above are constructed. The second part of the paper is devoted to func? tions of self?consciousness and to the application of the constructed models for designing plans and constructing new architectures of intelligent agents that are able, in particular, to distribute roles in coalitions.},

abstract = {Extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in recent years has induced the rapid growth of research areas related to UAV production. Among these, the design of control systems capable of automating a wide range of UAV activities is one of the most actively explored and evolving. Currently, researchers and developers are interested in designing control systems that can be referred to as intelligent, e.g. the systems which are suited to solve such tasks as planning, goal prioritization, coalition formation etc. and thus guarantee high levels of UAV autonomy. One of the principal problems in intelligent control system design is tying together various methods and models traditionally used in robotics and aimed at solving such tasks as dynamics modelling, control signal genera- tion, location and mapping, path planning etc. with the methods of behaviour modelling and planning which are thoroughly studied in cognitive science. Our work is aimed at solving this problem. We propose layered architecture — STRL (strategic, tactical, reactive, layered) — of the control system that au- tomates the behaviour generation using a cognitive approach while taking into account complex dynamics and kinematics of the control object (UAV).We use a special type of knowledge representation — sign world model — that is based on the psychological activity theory to describe individual behaviour planning and coalition formation processes. We also propose path planning methodology which serves as the mediator between the high-level cognitive activities and the reactive control signals generation. To generate these signals we use a state-dependent Riccati equation and specific method for solving it. We believe that utilization of the proposed architecture will broaden the spectrum of tasks which can be solved by the UAV’s coalition automatically, as well as raise the autonomy level of each individual member of that coalition.},
