	abstract = {In this paper we outline the approach of solving special type of navigation tasks for robotic systems, when a coalition of robots (agents) acts in the 2D environment, which can be modified by the actions, and share the same goal location. The latter is originally unreachable for some members of the coalition, but the common task still can be accomplished as the agents can assist each other (e.g. by modifying the environment). We call such tasks smart relocation tasks (as the can not be solved by pure path planning methods) and study spatial and behavior interaction of robots while solving them. We use cognitive approach and introduce semiotic knowledge representation — sign world model which underlines behavioral planning methodology. Planning is viewed as a recursive search process in the hierarchical state-space induced by sings with path planning signs reside on the lowest level. Reaching this level triggers path planning which is accomplished by state of the art grid-based planners focused on producing smooth paths (e.g. LIAN) and thus indirectly guarantying feasibility of that paths against agent’s dynamic constraints.},

@article{Osipov2014b,
	abstract = {Functions that are referred in psychology as functions of consciousness are considered. These functions include reflection, consciousness of activity motivation, goal setting, synthesis of goal oriented behavior, and some others. The description is based on the concept of sign, which is widely used in psychology and, in particular, in the cultural–historical theory by Vygotsky, in which sign is interpreted informally. In this paper, we elaborate upon the concept of sign, consider mechanisms of sign formation, and some self?organization on the set of signs. Due to the work of self?organization mechanisms, a new method for the representation of the world model of an actor appears. The concept of semiotic network is introduced that is used for the examination of the actor’s world models. Models of some functions indicated above are constructed. The second part of the paper is devoted to func? tions of self?consciousness and to the application of the constructed models for designing plans and constructing new architectures of intelligent agents that are able, in particular, to distribute roles in coalitions.},

	abstract = {Reviews research undertaken to create a theory of human natural language understanding. It is noted that those who have made attempts to solve the problem have had to restrict the domain of the particular problem that they were trying to solve, and sacrifice theoretical considerations for programming considerations. Psychiatric interviewing programs that have been written have not attempted to do much more than demonstrate that it is possible to have conversations with machines. It is suggested that what is needed, and what has been lacking, is a cohesive theory of how humans understand natural language without regard to particular subparts of that problem. A theory is described which is also intended to be a basis for computer programs that understand natural language. The initial premise of the theory is that the basis of natural language is conceptual. This base is interlingual, its elements are concepts not words. The conceptual content underlying an utterance is its meaning. Components of the system are a syntactic processor, a conceptual processor, and memories. Dependency relations between concepts form a network constituting the conceptual base.},
