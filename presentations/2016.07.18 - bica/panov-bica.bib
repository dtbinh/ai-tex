abstract = {Procedures for forming an element of an actor's world model (sign) introduced in the first part of this study are considered. The process of forming the pair image--sign significance taking into account the modern understanding of the human brain cortex operation is investigated. An algorithm for synthesizing a behavior plan is constructed, and a novel architecture of intelligent agents that are able, among other things, to distribute roles in coalitions is proposed.},

@article{Osipov2014b,
abstract = {Functions that are referred in psychology as functions of consciousness are considered. These functions include reflection, consciousness of activity motivation, goal setting, synthesis of goal oriented behavior, and some others. The description is based on the concept of sign, which is widely used in psychology and, in particular, in the culturalâ€“historical theory by Vygotsky, in which sign is interpreted informally. In this paper, we elaborate upon the concept of sign, consider mechanisms of sign formation, and some self?organization on the set of signs. Due to the work of self?organization mechanisms, a new method for the representation of the world model of an actor appears. The concept of semiotic network is introduced that is used for the examination of the actor's world models. Models of some functions indicated above are constructed. The second part of the paper is devoted to func? tions of self?consciousness and to the application of the constructed models for designing plans and constructing new architectures of intelligent agents that are able, in particular, to distribute roles in coalitions.},
