abstract = {We prove complexity, approximability, and inapproximability results for the problem of finding an exchange equilibrium in markets with indivisible (integer) goods, most notably a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the market equilibrium arbitrarily closely when the number of goods is bounded and the utilities are linear. We also show a communication complexity lower bound, implying that the ideal informational economy of a market with unique individual optima is unattainable in general.},
