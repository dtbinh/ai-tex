abstract = {In this paper, we review current knowledge on tool use development in infants in order to provide relevant information to cognitive developmental roboticists seeking to design artiﬁ- cial systems that develop tool use abilities.This information covers: 1) sketching developmental pathways leading to tool use competences; 2) the characterization of learning and test situations; 3) the crystallization of seven mechanisms underlying the developmental process; and 4) the formulation of a number of challenges and recommendations for designing artiﬁcial systems that exhibit tool use abilities in complex contexts},
