@article{Schank1972,
abstract = {Reviews research undertaken to create a theory of human natural language understanding. It is noted that those who have made attempts to solve the problem have had to restrict the domain of the particular problem that they were trying to solve, and sacrifice theoretical considerations for programming considerations. Psychiatric interviewing programs that have been written have not attempted to do much more than demonstrate that it is possible to have conversations with machines. It is suggested that what is needed, and what has been lacking, is a cohesive theory of how humans understand natural language without regard to particular subparts of that problem. A theory is described which is also intended to be a basis for computer programs that understand natural language. The initial premise of the theory is that the basis of natural language is conceptual. This base is interlingual, its elements are concepts not words. The conceptual content underlying an utterance is its meaning. Components of the system are a syntactic processor, a conceptual processor, and memories. Dependency relations between concepts form a network constituting the conceptual base.},

abstract = {Research and development (R and D) involves not only researchers but also many other specialists from different areas. All of them solve a variety of tasks that require comprehensive information and analytical support. This chapter discusses the major tasks arising in R and D: study of the state of the art in a given research area, prospects assessment of research fields and forecasting their development, quality assessment of scientific publications including plagiarism detection, and automated examination of proposed R and D projects. A number of informational and analytical systems have been developed to address these tasks. The main goal of this chapter is to give a review of R and D support functions of well-known and widely-used search and analytical systems and discuss information retrieval methods behind these functions.},
