abstract = {Many real world problems involve hybrid systems, subject to (continuous) physical effects and controlled by (discrete) digital equipments. Indeed, many efforts are being made to extend the current planning systems and modelling languages to support such kind of domains. However, hybrid systems often present also a nonlinear behaviour and planning with continuous nonlinear change that is still a challenging issue.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}In this paper we present the UPMurphi tool, a universal planner based on the discretise and validate approach that is capable of reasoning with mixed discrete/continuous domains, fully respecting the semantics of PDDL+. Given an initial discretisation, the hybrid system is discretised and given as input to UPMurphi, which performs universal planning on such an approximated model and checks the correctness of the results. If the validation fails, the approach is repeated by appropriately refining the discretisation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}To show the effectiveness of our approach, the paper presents two real hybrid domains where universal planning has been successfully performed using the UPMurphi tool.},
