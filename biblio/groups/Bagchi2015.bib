abstract = {The brain is a neurological device capable to carry out distributed computation and express cognition. The computational models of consciousness and cognition have potential applications in bio-inspired computing paradigm. This paper proposes a computational model of consciousness as a cognitive function following neurophysiology and elements of distributed computing. It is illustrated that the distributed computational model of consciousness has a basis in the quantum mechanical models in explaining the neurological cognitive functions. The transitions between the computing model and quantum basis are explained and analyzed considering different linear Hermitian operators.},
