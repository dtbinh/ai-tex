abstract = {This short work is a follow-up on the review of the online Comparative Table of Cognitive Architectures, published in the BICA 2010 Proceedings. While the original review listed architectures and their features in one uniform format, the primary goal here is to go through feature-by-feature comparison across architectures and to see what features are shared, unique or missing in particular cases, in hope to understand what is needed in order to make a leap forward. This analysis is followed by consideration of the universal learner critical mass problem. {\textcopyright} 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},
