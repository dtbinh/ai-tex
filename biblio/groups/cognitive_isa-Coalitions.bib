abstract = {To engage diverse agents in cooperative behavior, it is important, even necessary, to provide algo- rithms that do not reveal information that is private or proprietary. A number of recent planning algo- rithms enable agents to plan together for shared goals without disclosing information about their private state and actions. But these algorithms lack clear and formal privacy guarantees: the fact that they do not require agents to explicitly reveal pri- vate information, does not imply that such informa- tion cannot be deduced. The main contribution of this paper is an enhanced version of the distributed forward-search planning framework of Nissim and Brafman that reveals less information than the orig- inal algorithm, and the first, to our knowledge, dis- cussion and formal proof of privacy guarantees for distributed planning and search algorithms.},

abstract = {The scientific research in the area of computational mechanisms for trust and reputation in virtual societies is a recent discipline oriented to increase the reliability and performance of electronic communities. Computer science has moved from the paradigm of isolated machines to the paradigm of networks and distributed computing. Likewise, artificial intelligence is quickly moving from the paradigm of isolated and non-situated intelligence to the paradigm of situated, social and collective intelligence. The new paradigm of the so called intelligent or autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) together with the spectacular emergence of the information society technologies (specially reflected by the popularization of electronic commerce) are responsible for the increasing interest on trust and reputation mechanisms applied to electronic societies. This review wants to offer a panoramic view on current computational trust and reputation models.},

abstract = {Agent teaming and autonomy are foundational themes in multi-agent systems. Agents may work as singletons or they may work in environments where other agents exist. In multi-agent systems, agents may form teams by sharing common goals with other agents. Cooperation is essential for any collaborative, group activity. Beyond coordination and judicious role assignment, cooperation enables members of a team to be aware and account for collection of their goals as well as the performance of agents on individual goals. This paper presents a general model of cooperation and illustrates how it may enhance group performance. In this paper, we present results of an application of the concept of cooperation in a simulated swarm of reconnaissance urban UAVs that are tracking vehicles in an urban environment.},

@article{Crosby2014,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach to multiagent planning in domains with concurrent actions and associated concurrent action constraints. In these domains, we associate the actions of individual agents with subsets of objects, which allows for a transformation of the problems into single-agent planning problems that are considerably easier to solve. The transformation forces agents to select joint actions associated with a single subset of objects at a time, and ensures that the concurrency constraints on this subset are satisfied. Joint actions are serialised such that each agent performs their part of the action separately. The number of actions in the resulting single-agent planning problem turns out to be manageable in many real-world domains, thus allowing the problem to be solved efficiently using a standard single-agent planner. We also describe a cost-optimal algorithm for compressing the resulting plan, i.e. merging individual actions in order to reduce the total number of joint actions. Results show that our approach can handle large problems that are impossible to solve for most multiagent planners.},

We describe our algorithm alongside representative use cases, with an evaluation based on solving complex circuit building problems.

abstract = {Finding reliable partners to interact with in open environments is a challenging task for software agents, and trust and reputation mechanisms are used to handle this issue. From this viewpoint, we can observe the growing body of research on this subject, which indicates that these mechanisms can be considered key elements to design multiagent systems (MASs). Based on that, this article presents an extensive but not exhaustive review about the most significant trust and reputation models published over the past two decades, and hundreds of models were analyzed using two perspectives. The first one is a combination of trust dimensions and principles proposed by some relevant authors in the field, and the models are discussed using an MAS perspective. The second one is the discussion of these dimensions taking into account some types of interaction found in MASs, such as coalition, argumentation, negotiation, and recommendation. By these analyses, we aim to find significant relations between trust dimensions and types of interaction so it would be possible to construct MASs using the most relevant dimensions according to the types of interaction, which may help developers in the design of MASs. es, and Fabr{\'{i}}cio Enembreck. 2015.

abstract = {As we progress towards a world where robots play an integral role in society, a critical problem that remains to be solved is the pickup team challenge; that is, dynamically formed heterogeneous robot teams executing coordinated tasks where little information is known a priori about the tasks, the robots, and the environments in which they would operate. Successful solutions to forming pickup teams would enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge of pickup teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the performance of pickup teams. Additionally, we describe a basic implementation of a pickup team that can search and discover treasure in a previously unknown environment. We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task},

@article{Nikolaidis2014,
abstract = {We present a framework for learning human user models from joint-action demonstrations that enables the robot to compute a robust policy for a collaborative task with a human. The learning takes place completely automatically, without any human intervention. First, we describe the clustering of demonstrated action sequences into different human types using an unsupervised learning algorithm. These demonstrated sequences are also used by the robot to learn a reward function that is representative for each type, through the employment of an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. The learned model is then used as part of a Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process formulation, wherein the human type is a partially observable variable. With this framework, we can infer, either offline or online, the human type of a new user that was not included in the training set, and can compute a policy for the robot that will be aligned to the preference of this new user and will be robust to deviations of the human actions from prior demonstrations. Finally we validate the approach using data collected in human subject experiments, and conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations in which a person performs a collaborative task with a small industrial robot.},

abstract = {Multiagent planning is a coordination technique used for deliberative acting of a team of agents. One of vital planning techniques uses declarative description of agents' plans based on Finite State Machines and their later coordination by intersection of such machines with successive verification of the resulting joint plans. In this work, we firstly propose to use projections of agents' actions directly for multiagent planning based on iterative building of a coordinated multiagent plan. Secondly, we describe integration of the static analysis provided by process calculi type systems for approximate verification of exchanged local plans. Finally, we compare our approach with current state-of-the-art planner on an extensive benchmark set.},
