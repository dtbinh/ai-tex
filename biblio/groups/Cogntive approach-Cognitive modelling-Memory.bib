@article{Klampfl2013,
abstract = {Numerous experimental data suggest that simultaneously or sequentially activated assemblies of neurons play a key role in the storage and computational use of long-term memory in the brain. However, a model that elucidates how these memory traces could emerge through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has been missing. We show here that stimulus-specific assemblies of neurons emerge automatically through STDP in a simple cortical microcircuit model. The model that we consider is a randomly connected network of well known microcircuit motifs: pyramidal cells with lateral inhibition. We show that the emergent assembly codes for repeatedly occurring spatiotemporal input patterns tend to fire in some loose, sequential manner that is reminiscent of experimentally observed stereotypical trajectories of network states. We also show that the emergent assembly codes add an important computational capability to standard models for online computations in cortical microcircuits: the capability to integrate information from long-term memory with information from novel spike inputs.},

@article{Battaglia2011,
abstract = {After acquisition, memories underlie a process of consolidation, making them more resistant to interference and brain injury. Memory consolidation involves systems-level interactions, most importantly between the hippocampus and associated structures, which takes part in the initial encoding of memory, and the neocortex, which supports long-term storage. This dichotomy parallels the contrast between episodic memory (tied to the hippocampal formation), collecting an autobiographical stream of experiences, and semantic memory, a repertoire of facts and statistical regularities about the world, involving the neocortex at large. Experimental evidence points to a gradual transformation of memories, following encoding, from an episodic to a semantic character. This may require an exchange of information between different memory modules during inactive periods. We propose a theory for such interactions and for the formation of semantic memory, in which episodic memory is encoded as relational data. Semantic memory is modeled as a modified stochastic grammar, which learns to parse episodic configurations expressed as an association matrix. The grammar produces tree-like representations of episodes, describing the relationships between its main constituents at multiple levels of categorization, based on its current knowledge of world regularities. These regularities are learned by the grammar from episodic memory information, through an expectation-maximization procedure, analogous to the inside-outside algorithm for stochastic context-free grammars. We propose that a Monte-Carlo sampling version of this algorithm can be mapped on the dynamics of "sleep replay" of previously acquired information in the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that the model can reproduce several properties of semantic memory such as decontextualization, top-down processing, and creation of schemata.},

abstract = {Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) tries to mimic the computing in cerebral-neocortex. It identifies spatial and temporal patterns in the input for making inferences. This may require large number of computationally expensive tasks like, dot-product evaluations. Nano-devices that can provide direct mapping for such primitives are of great interest. In this work we show that the computing blocks for HTM can be mapped using low-voltage, fast-switching, magneto-metallic spin-neurons combined with emerging resistive cross-bar network (RCN). Results show possibility of more than 200x lower energy as compared to 45nm CMOS ASIC design},

@article{Dipoppa2013,
abstract = {Cognitive effort leads to a seeming cacophony of brain oscillations. For example, during tasks engaging working memory (WM), specific oscillatory frequency bands modulate in space and time. Despite ample data correlating such modulation to task performance, a mechanistic explanation remains elusive. We propose that flexible control of neural oscillations provides a unified mechanism for the rapid and controlled transitions between the computational operations required by WM. We show in a spiking network model that modulating the input oscillation frequency sets the network in different operating modes: rapid memory access and load is enabled by the beta-gamma oscillations, maintaining a memory while ignoring distractors by the theta, rapid memory clearance by the alpha. The various frequency bands determine the dynamic gating regimes enabling the necessary operations for WM, whose succession explains the need for the complex oscillatory brain dynamics during effortful cognition.},
