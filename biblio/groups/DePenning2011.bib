abstract = {In real-world applications, the effective integration of learning and reasoning in a cognitive agent model is a difficult task. However, such integration may lead to a better understanding, use and con- struction of more realistic models. Unfortunately, existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, con- trolled environments like training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In par- ticular, higher-order concepts and cognitive abili- ties have many unknown temporal relations with the data, making it impossible to represent such re- lationships by hand. We introduce a novel cogni- tive agent model and architecture for online learn- ing and reasoning that seeks to effectively repre- sent, learn and reason in complex training envi- ronments. The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation. It is capable of learning new hy- potheses from observed data, and infers new be- liefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a stochastic inference model in the spirit of Bayesian inference. The validation of the model on real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenar- ios, with possible applications in a range of areas.},
