abstract = {Recent work in human cognitive neuroscience has linked self-consciousness to the processing of multisen- sory bodily signals (bodily self-consciousness [BSC]) in fronto-parietal cortex and more posterior temporo- parietal regions.Wehighlight the behavioral, neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and computational laws that subtend BSCin humans and non-human primates.Wepropose thatBSCincludes body-centered perception (hand, face, and trunk), based on the integration of proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual bodily inputs, and involves spatio-temporal mechanisms integrating multisensory bodily stimuli within peripersonal space (PPS). We develop four major constraints of BSC (proprioception, body-related visual information, PPS, and embodiment) and argue that the fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal processing of trunk-centered multisensory signals in PPS is of particular relevance for theoretical models and simulations of BSC and eventually of self-consciousness.},
