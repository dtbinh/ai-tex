abstract = {What type of probability theory best describes the way humans make judgments under uncertainty and decisions under conflict? Although rational models of cognition have become prominent and have achieved much success, they adhere to the laws of classical probability theory despite the fact that human reasoning does not always conform to these laws. For this reason we have seen the recent emergence of models based on an alternative probabilistic framework drawn from quantum theory. These quantum models show promise in addressing cognitive phenomena that have proven recalcitrant to modeling by means of classical probability theory. This review compares and contrasts probabilistic models based on Bayesian or classical versus quantum principles, and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.},

@article{Dehaene2015,
abstract = {A sequence of images, sounds, or words can be stored at several levels of detail, from specific items and their timing to abstract structure. We propose a taxonomy of five distinct cerebral mechanisms for sequence coding: transitions and timing knowledge, chunking, ordinal knowledge, algebraic patterns, and nested tree structures. In each case, we review the available experimental paradigms and list the behavioral and neural signatures of the systems involved. Tree structures require a specific recursive neural code, as yet unidentified by electrophysiology, possibly unique to humans, and which may explain the singularity of human language and cognition.},

@article{Augello2015,
abstract = {Evaluation is a key factor of creativity: for this reason it should be integrated into a cognitive architecture of a creative artificial agent. The approach illustrated in this paper uses the Psi model, and describes the framework for introducing internal and external evaluations, and how they influence demands and motivation of the artificial agent. Internal evaluation mechanisms drive the creative process, and influence competence of the creative agent. External evaluation acts through certainty, and requires interaction with human users that express both opinions and some subjective quantitative evaluations on the final artwork. The system uses natural language processing techniques in order to infer the satisfaction and the emotional impact of the final product obtained by the creative agent.},
