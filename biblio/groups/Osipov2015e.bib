abstract = {Procedures for forming an element of an actor's world model (sign) introduced in the first part of this study are considered. The process of forming the pair image--sign significance taking into account the modern understanding of the human brain cortex operation is investigated. An algorithm for synthesizing a behavior plan is constructed, and a novel architecture of intelligent agents that are able, among other things, to distribute roles in coalitions is proposed.},
