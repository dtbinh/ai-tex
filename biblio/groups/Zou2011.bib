abstract = {Natural scenes in a video stream contain rich collections of visual transformations. In this paper, a generic neural network is built to learn visual invariance from videos in an unsupervised manner. We use temporal coherence to learn both visual transformations and features with complex invariances. Without fine tuning with labels, our invariant features are superior for classifying object in still images. The learned features out-perform features learned with sparsity in vision benchmarks Caltech-101, STL-10 and COIL-100.},
