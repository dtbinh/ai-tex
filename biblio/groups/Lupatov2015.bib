abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) vaccination is a promising way to contend cancer metastases especially in the case of immunogenic tumors. Unfortunately, it is only rarely possible to achieve a satisfactory clinical outcome in the majority of patients treated with a particular DC vaccine. Apparently, DC vaccination can be successful with certain combinations of features of the tumor and patients immune system that are not yet fully revealed. Difficulty in predicting the results of the therapy and high price of preparation of individual vaccines prevent wider use of DC vaccines in medical practice. Here we propose an approach aimed to uncover correlation between the effectiveness of specific DC vaccine types and personal characteristics of patients to increase efficiency of cancer treatment and reduce prices. To accomplish this, we suggest two-step analysis of published clinical trials results for DCs vaccines: first, the information extraction subsystem is trained, and, second, the extracted data is analyzed using JSM and AQ methodology.},
