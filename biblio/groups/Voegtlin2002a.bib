abstract = {This paper explores the combination of self-organizing map (SOM) and feedback, in order to represent sequences of inputs. In general, neural networks with time-delayed feedback represent time implicitly, by combining current inputs and past activities. It has been difficult to apply this approach to SOM, because feedback generates instability during learning. We demonstrate a solution to this problem, based on a nonlinearity. The result is a generalization of SOM that learns to represent sequences recursively. We demonstrate that the resulting representations are adapted to the temporal statistics of the input series. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
