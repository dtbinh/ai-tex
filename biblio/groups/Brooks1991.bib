abstract = {Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation.$\backslash$nWhen intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict$\backslash$nreliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and$\backslash$naction, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline$\backslash$nour approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures.$\backslash$nThe fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into$\backslash$nindependent information processing units which must interface with$\backslash$neach other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is$\backslash$n$\backslash$ndecomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which$\backslash$nall interface directly to the world through perception and action,$\backslash$nrather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions$\backslash$nof central and peripheral systems evaporateeverything is both central$\backslash$nand peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful$\backslash$nseries of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures$\backslash$nin standard office environments.},
