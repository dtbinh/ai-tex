abstract = {We introduce a framework that enables an agent to autonomously learn its own symbolic representation of a low-level, continuous environment. Propositional symbols are formalized as names for probability distributions, providing a nat-ural means of dealing with uncertain rep-resentations and probabilistic plans. We determine the symbols that are sufficient for computing the probability with which a plan will succeed, and demonstrate the acquisition of a symbolic representation in a computer game domain.},
