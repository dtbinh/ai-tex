abstract = {Our research purpose is to realize a consciousness system on computers. In this paper, we focus on the relation between a primary system that directly interacts and learns the input-output relation within an environment, and a secondary system that continuously monitors and is able to direct the primary system. We hold that consciousness is not composed of a primary system alone, but that the employment of a secondary system is essential. The purpose of this paper is therefore to clarify the importance of a secondary system. We show by numerical experiments that the addition of a secondary system provides adaptability to a wider range of environmental changes than a primary system alone. Alternatively, we present an extraordinary case where a customized primary system fully adapts to an environment undergoing a particular type of change. Far from refuting the value of a secondary system, this special case serves to point out the importance of the effective design of a secondary system. Therefore, we confirm the value and usefulness of a secondary system in a machine consciousness system through these numericalexperiments.},
