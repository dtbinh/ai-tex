abstract = {The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) is a model of knowledge of large-scale space consisting of multiple interacting representations, both qualitative and quantitative. It is inspired by the properties of the human cognitive map, and is intended to serve both as a model of the human cognitive map and as a method for robot exploration and map-building. This article describes the assumptions and guarantees behind the generality of the SSH across environments and sensorimotor systems. Evidence is given from several partial implementation of the SSH on simulated and physical robots.},
