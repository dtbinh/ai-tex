abstract = {Conceptors provide an elementary neuro-computational mechanism which sheds a fresh and unifying light on a diversity of cognitive phenomena. A number of demanding learning and processing tasks can be solved with unprecedented ease, robustness and accuracy. Some of these tasks were impossible to solve before. This entirely informal paper introduces the basic principles of conceptors and highlights some of their usages.},
