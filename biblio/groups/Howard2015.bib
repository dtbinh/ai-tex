abstract = {We have created a high-fidelity model of 9 regions of the brain involved in making sense of complex and uncertain situations. Sense making is a proactive form of situation awareness requiring sifting through information of various types to form hypotheses about evolving situations. The MINDS model (Mirroring Intelligence in a Neural Description of Sensemaking) reveals the neural principles and cognitive tradeoffs that explain weaknesses in human reasoning and decision-making.},
