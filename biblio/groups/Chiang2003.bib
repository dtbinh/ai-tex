abstract = {In this paper, the support vector clustering is ex- tended to an adaptive cell growing model which maps data points to a high dimensional feature space through a desired kernel function. This generalized model is called multiple spheres sup- port vector clustering, which essentially identifies dense regions in the original space by finding their corresponding spheres with minimal radius in the feature space. A multisphere clustering algorithm based on adaptive cluster cell growing method is devel- oped, whereby it is possible to obtain the grade of memberships, as well as cluster prototypes in partition. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for the problem of arbitrary cluster shapes and for prototype identification in an actual application to a handwritten digit data set.},
