abstract = {This paper introduces feedback connections into a previously proposed model of the simple and complex neurons of the neocortex. The original model considers only feedforward connections between a SOM (Self-Organizing Map) and a RSOM (Recurrent SOM). A variant of the SOM-RSOM pair is proposed, called LoopSOM. The RSOM sends predictions to the SOM, providing more robust pattern classification/recognition and solving ambiguities.},
