abstract = {To engage diverse agents in cooperative behavior, it is important, even necessary, to provide algo- rithms that do not reveal information that is private or proprietary. A number of recent planning algo- rithms enable agents to plan together for shared goals without disclosing information about their private state and actions. But these algorithms lack clear and formal privacy guarantees: the fact that they do not require agents to explicitly reveal pri- vate information, does not imply that such informa- tion cannot be deduced. The main contribution of this paper is an enhanced version of the distributed forward-search planning framework of Nissim and Brafman that reveals less information than the orig- inal algorithm, and the first, to our knowledge, dis- cussion and formal proof of privacy guarantees for distributed planning and search algorithms.},
