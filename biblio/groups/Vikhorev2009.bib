abstract = {We present a new approach to providing soft real- time guarantees for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. We define what it means for BDI agents to operate in real time, or to satisfy real-time guarantees. We then develop a model of real-time performance which takes into account the time by which a task should be performed and the relative priority of tasks, and identify the key stages in a BDI architecture which must be bounded for real-time performance. As an illustration of our approach we introduce a new BDI architecture, ARTS, which allows the development of agents that guarantee (soft) real-time performance. ARTS extends ideas from PRS and JAM to include goals and plans which have deadlines and priorities, and schedules intentions so as to achieve the largest number of high priority intentions by their deadlines.},
