abstract = {This paper compares two Self-Organizing Map (SOM) based$\backslash$nmodels for temporal sequence processing (TSP) both$\backslash$nanalytically and experimentally. These models, Temporal$\backslash$nKohonen Map (TKM) and Recurrent Self-Organizing Map (RSOM),$\backslash$nincorporate leaky integrator memory to preserve the$\backslash$ntemporal context of the input signals. The learning and the$\backslash$nconvergence properties of the TKM and RSOM are studied and$\backslash$nwe show analytically that the RSOM is a significant$\backslash$nimprovement over the TKM, because the RSOM allows simple$\backslash$nderivation of a consistent learning rule. The results of$\backslash$nthe analysis are demonstrated with experiments.},
