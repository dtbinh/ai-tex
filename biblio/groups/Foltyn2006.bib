abstract = {Multi-agent systems penetrate into interesting domains of computing with limited resources, programme code reusability and automated code generation. This paper presents general framework of Reflective-Cognitive agent architecture which enables the agent to alter its own code in runtime according to the changes in the environment. We also present results of architecture implementation showing the plausibility of created prototype.},
