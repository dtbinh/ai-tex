abstract = {In human-robot interactive scenarios communication and col- laboration during task execution are crucial issues. Since the human be- havior is unpredictable and ambiguous, an interactive robotic system is to continuously interpret intentions and goals adapting its executive and communicative processes according to the users behaviors. In this work, we propose an integrated system that exploits attentional mechanisms to flexibly adapt planning and executive processes to the multimodal human-robot interaction.},
