abstract = {This paper concerns a new class of systems that are, on the one hand, dynamic systems, and on the other, intelligent systems, as their dynamics is described by knowledge representation, which is a common practice to use in intelligent systems, and the states are described by parameters and variables that have a logical or linguistic character. The case is considered when the rule system is used as a method of knowledge representation.},
