abstract = {Research and development (R and D) involves not only researchers but also many other specialists from different areas. All of them solve a variety of tasks that require comprehensive information and analytical support. This chapter discusses the major tasks arising in R and D: study of the state of the art in a given research area, prospects assessment of research fields and forecasting their development, quality assessment of scientific publications including plagiarism detection, and automated examination of proposed R and D projects. A number of informational and analytical systems have been developed to address these tasks. The main goal of this chapter is to give a review of R and D support functions of well-known and widely-used search and analytical systems and discuss information retrieval methods behind these functions.},
