abstract = {Most of the great success of heuristic search as an approach to AI Planning is due to the right design of domain-independent heuristics. Although many heuris- tic planners perform reasonablywell, the computational cost of computing the heuristic function in every search node is very high, causing the planner to scale poorly when increas- ing the size of the planning tasks. For tackling this prob- lem, planners can incorporate additional domain-dependent heuristics in order to improve their performance. Learning- based planners try to automatically acquire these domain- dependent heuristics using previous solved problems. In this work, we present a case-based reasoning approach that learns abstracted state transitions that serve as domain con- trol knowledge for improving the planning process. The rec- ommendations from the retrieved cases are used as guidance for pruning or ordering nodes in different heuristic search al- gorithms applied to planning tasks. We show that the CBR guidance is appropriate for a considerable number of plan- ning benchmarks.},
