abstract = {Expertise consists of rapid selection and application of compiled experience. Robust reasoning, however, requires adaptation to new contingencies and intelligent modification of past experience. And novel or creative reasoning, by its real nature, necessitates general problem-solving abilities unconstrained by past behavior. This article presents a comprehensive computational model of analogical (case-based) reasoning that transitions smoothly between case replay, case adaptation, and general problem solving, exploiting and modifying past experience when available and resorting to general problem-solving methods when required. Learning occurs by accumulation of new cases, especially in situations that required extensive problem solving, and by tuning the indexing structure of the memory model to retrieve progressively more appropriate cases. The derivational replay mechanism is discussed in some detail, and extensive results of the first full implementation are presented. These results show up to a large performance improvement in a simple transportation domain for structurally similar problems, and smaller improvements when less strict similarity metrics are used for problems that share partial structure in a process-job planning domain and in an extended version of the strips robot domain.},
