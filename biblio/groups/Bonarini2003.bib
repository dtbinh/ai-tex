abstract = {We propose an architecture to implement coordination among fuzzy behavior modules for autonomous agents, in real-time tasks. Behavior coordination is obtained by fuzzy conditions and motivations evaluated on information provided by intelligent sensors and a world modeler. We also discuss the compatibility of our architecture with cognitive models. We present the application of this architecture in one of the domains we have faced with it: service and edutainment robotics. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
