abstract = {A technique for simultaneous planning and action based on dynamic field theory is presented. The model builds on previous work on representation of sequential behavior as attractors in dynamic neural fields. Here, we demonstrate how chains of competing attractors can be used to represent dynamic plans towards a goal state. The present work can be seen as an addition to a growing body of work that demonstrates the role of dynamic field theory as a bridge between low-level reactive approaches and high-level symbol processing mechanisms. The architecture is evaluated on a set of planning problems using a simulated e-puck robot, including analysis of the system's behavior in response to noise and temporary blockages of the planned route. The system makes no explicit distinction between planning and execution phases, allowing continuous adaptation of the planned path. The proposed architecture exploits the dynamic field theory property of stability in relation to noise and changes in the environment. The neural dynamics are also exploited such that stay-or-switch action selection emerges where blockage of a planned path occurs; stay until the transient blockage is removed versus switch to an alternative route to the goal.},
