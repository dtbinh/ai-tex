abstract = {The problem of the thinking process modeling is considered within the context of Dynamical Theory of Information. The proposed definition for thinking process is based on listing its main goals and functions. A set of various type neural processors is considered to reveal necessary and sufficient combination to implement these basic functions. It is shown that, according to DTI, the artificial thinking system is to be divided into two subsystems, where the first subsystem provides generation of information and learning, the second one - storage and application of the information. This correlates with presence of two hemispheres of the human brain, one of them is believed to produce the intuition, while the other one being responsible for the logical thinking. A particular version of the thinking-system architecture is proposed. It is shown that in the course of evolution, the system is progressively growing from low imaginary information levels, through semantic levels (where the information has sense for this individual system only), up to high abstract levels that could be verbalized to be generally realized. An interpretation of intuitive and logical thinking is given. Our approach, being close to that common for BICA, does differ in certain points. We are not dealing with the active agents that are a priori endowed with emotions, motivations, and comprehension. Instead, starting with just formal (but dynamical) neurons, the system itself, due to the self-organizing nonlinear interactions of the neuron ensembles, could produce semantic and abstract information, and perceive the verbalized one. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.
