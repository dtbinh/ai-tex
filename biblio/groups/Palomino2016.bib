abstract = {This paper presents a novel attention-based cognitive architecture for a social robot. This architecture aims to join perception and reasoning considering a double interplay: the current task biases the perceptual process whereas perceived items determine the behaviours to be accomplished, considering the present context and role of the agent. Therefore, the proposed architecture represents a bidirectional solution to the perception-reasoning-action loop closing problem. The proposal is divided into two levels of performance, employing anObject-BasedVisual Attention model as perception system and a general purpose Planning Framework at the top deliberative level. The architecture has been tested using a real and unrestricted environment that involves a real robot, time-varying tasks and daily life situations.},
