abstract = {Human-level intelligent agents must autonomously navigate complex, dynamic, uncertain environments with bounded time and memory. This requires that they continually update a hierarchical, dynamic, probabilistic (uncertain) internal model of their current situation, via approximate Bayesian inference, incorporating both the sensory data and a generative model of its causes. Such modeling requires suitable representation at multiple levels of abstraction from the sub-symbolic, sensory level to the most abstract conceptual representation. To guide our approach, we identify principles for perceptual representation, perceptual inference, and the associated learning processes. Based on these, a predictive coding extension to the HTM Cortical Learning Algorithms, termed PC-CLA, is proposed as a foundational building block for the systems-level LIDA cognitive architecture. PC-CLA fleshes out LIDA's internal representations, memory, learning and attentional processes; and takes an initial step towards the comprehensive use of distributed and probabilistic (uncertain) representation throughout the architecture.},
