abstract = {Abstract This article represents an extension of authors' previous papers (Chernavskaya, Chernavskii, Karp, Nikitin, {\&} Shchepetov, 2012, 2013) in modeling cognitive systems on the base of the Dynamical Theory of Information. The paper focuses on the problem of account for emotions in artificial system. The main hypothesis consists in the assumption that emotions inherent in a living system could be simulated by variation of amplitude of the occasional component (noise) inherently embedded into the architecture of artificial system. Within this concept, increasing noise amplitude should correspond to negative emotions (anxiety), while its decreasing provides positive emotions (relaxation, pleasure). A rapid up-and-down spike in the noise amplitude could imitate a laugh. This hypothesis is secured by incorporation of an additional dynamical variable that represents an analogy to the compound of neural mediators in human beings. The system of linked equations in terms of “noise amplitude – neurotransmitter compound” is proposed to describe mutual influence of the cognitive process and emotional component. The model permits to reproduce qualitatively certain prominent effects typical for human emotional reactions (like stress and shock).},
