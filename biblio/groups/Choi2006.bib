abstract = {In this paper, we present a fast algorithm for constructing a concept (Galois) lattice of a binary relation, including computing all concepts and their lattice order. We also present two efficient variants of the algorithm, one for computing all concepts only, and one for constructing a frequent closed itemset lattice. The running time of our algorithms depends on the lattice structure and is faster than all other existing algorithms for these problems.},
