abstract = {Concerned with understanding and modeling commonsense reasoning with a combination of rules and similarities under a connectionist rubric. Examines the areas of reasoning, connectionist models, inheritance, causality, rule-based systems and similarity-based reasoning. Introduces a new structure, a novel connectionist architecture and a set of fresh ideas leading to new applications.},

@article{Garcez2015,
abstract = {The goal of neural-symbolic computation is to integrate ro- bust connectionist learning and sound symbolic reasoning. With the recent advances in connectionist learning, in par- ticular deep neural networks, forms of representation learn- ing have emerged. However, such representations have not become useful for reasoning. Results from neural-symbolic computation have shown to offer powerful alternatives for knowledge representation, learning and reasoning in neural computation. This paper recalls the main contributions and discusses key challenges for neural-symbolic integration which have been identified at a recent Dagstuhl seminar.},
