abstract = {This paper presents a simple, sound, complete, and systematic algorithm for domain independent STRIPS planning. Simplicity is achieved by starting with a ground procedure and then applying a general, and independently verifiable, lifting transformation. Previous planners have been designed directly as lifted procedures. Our ground procedure is a ground version of Tate's NONLINE procedure. In Tate's procedure one is not required to determine whether a prerequisite of a step in an unfinished plan is guarateed to hold in all linearizations. This allows Tate's procedure to avoid the use of Chapman's modal truth criterion. Systematicity is the property that the same plan, or partial plan, is never examined more than once. Systematicity is achieved through a simple modification of Tate's procedure.},
