abstract = {The GLAIR grounded layered architecture with integrated reasoning for cognitive robots and intelligent autonomous agents has been used in a series of projects in which Cassie, the SNePS cognitive agent, has been incorporated into hardware- or software-simulated cognitive robots. In this paper, we present an informal, but coherent, overview of the GLAIR approach to anchoring the abstract symbolic terms that denote an agent's mental entities in the lower-level structures used by the embodied agent to operate in the real (or simulated) world. We discuss anchoring in the domains of: perceivable entities and properties, actions, time, and language.},
