abstract = {A shared use of the AQ learning and JSM method in extracting cause–effect relationships from psychological test data is considered. The AQ learning is used to descript a test group using rules. The group description is a basis for constructing the factbase of the JSM method. The first stage of the JSM method is used for hypothesizing on cause–effect relationships in the factbase. A complete algorithm of the developed method is described and recommendations for its use are provided. A contrasting analysis of the results of the proposed method and statistical processing results is performed.},
