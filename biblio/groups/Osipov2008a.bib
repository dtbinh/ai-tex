abstract = {The paper suggests a classification of dynamic rule-based systems. For each class of systems, limit behavior is studied. Systems with stabilizing limit states or stabilizing limit trajectories are identified, and such states and trajectories are found. The structure of the set of limit states and trajectories is investigated.},
