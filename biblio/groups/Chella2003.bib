abstract = {This paper deals with the anchoring of one of the most influential symbolic formalisms used in cognitive robotics, namely the situation calculus, to a conceptual representation of dynamic scenarios. Our proposal is developed with reference to a cognitive architecture for robot vision. An experimental setup is presented, aimed at obtaining intelligent monitoring operations of a robotic finger starting from visual data. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
