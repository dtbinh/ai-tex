@article{Plunkett1992,
abstract = {Describes a connectionist model of concept formation and vocabulary growth that auto-associates image representations and their associated labels. The model implements several well-known findings in the literature on early semantic development. It is shown how these apparently disparate findings can be attributed to the operation of a single underlying mechanism. The model represents a 1st step toward providing a formal explanation of the emergence of symbolic behavior in young children.
