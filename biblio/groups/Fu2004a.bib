abstract = {Concept lattice is an effective tool and platform for data analysis and knowledge discovery such as classification or association rules mining. The lattice algorithm to build formal concepts and concept lattice plays an essential role in the application of concept lattice. In fact, more than ten algorithms for generating concept lattices were published. As real data sets for data mining are very large, concept lattice structure suffers from its complexity issues on such data. The efficiency and performance of concept lattices algorithms are very different from one to another.In order to increase the efficiency of concept lattice-based algorithms in data mining, it is necessary to make use of an efficient algorithm to build concept lattices.So we need to com- pare the existing lattice algorithms and develop more efficient algorithm. We implemented the four first algorithms in Java environment and compared these algorithms on about 30 datasets of the UCI repository that are well established to be used to compare ML algorithms. Preliminary results give preference to Ganter's algorithm, and then to Bordat's algorithm, nevertheless these algorithms still suffers when dealing with huge datasets. We analyzed the duality of the lattice-based algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a new efficient scalable lattice-based algorithm: ScalingNextClosure to decompose the search space of any huge data in some partitions, and then generate independently concepts in each partition. The experimental results show the efficiency of this algorithm.},
