abstract = {Despite a recent increase of research activity in the field of multi-agent planning there is still no de-facto standard for the description of multi-agent planning problems similarly to the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) in case of deterministic single-agent planning. For this reason, in this paper a multi-agent extension of the currently latest official version of PDDL (3.1) is proposed together with a corresponding multi-agent planning track for the International Planning Competition (IPC). Our aim is to allow for a more direct comparison of planning systems and approaches, a greater reuse of research, and a more coordinated development in the field. Multi-agent planning is fundamentally different from the single-agent case with a broad range of applications (e.g. multi-robot domains). Not only is it inherently harder because of an exponential increase of the number of actions in general, but among others also constructive/destructive synergies of concurrent actions, and agents' different abilities and goals may need to be considered. The proposed multi-agent extension copes with these issues and allows planning both for and by agents even in temporal, numeric domains. It implies minimal changes to the syntax of PDDL3.1 and the related parsers.},
