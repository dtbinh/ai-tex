abstract = {In this paper a sign-based or semiotic formalism is considered. The concept of sign arose in the framework of semiotics. Neurophysiological and psychological researches indicate sign-based structures, which are the basic elements of the world model of a human subject. These elements are formed during his/her activity and communication. In this formalism it was possible to formulate and solve the problem of goal-setting, i.e. generating the goal of behavior.},
