abstract = {In this paper we survey the basics of reinforcement learning, gener- alization and abstraction. We start with an introduction to the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and motivate the necessity for generalization and abstrac- tion. Next we summarize themost important techniques available to achieve both generalization and abstraction in reinforcement learning. We discuss basic func- tion approximation techniques and delve into hierarchical, relational and transfer learning. All concepts and techniques are illustrated with examples.},
