abstract = {This paper presents an approach for controlling collision avoidance among a group of moving multi-agents such that they are not able to communicate with each other and hence, cannot share information. The basics and key features of our collision control algorithm are discussed to include practical examinations. Our approach is based on multi-agent systems and help moving agents to pursue their goals using collision free routes. In terms of validating our solution, we plan to apply into a configuration set of agents located in our experimental space. We also explain our solution algorithm that we have developed, along with the examination that we subjected it to, as well as sketching some of the most important challenges that remain to be addresses in our future researches.},
