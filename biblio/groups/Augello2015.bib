abstract = {Evaluation is a key factor of creativity: for this reason it should be integrated into a cognitive architecture of a creative artificial agent. The approach illustrated in this paper uses the Psi model, and describes the framework for introducing internal and external evaluations, and how they influence demands and motivation of the artificial agent. Internal evaluation mechanisms drive the creative process, and influence competence of the creative agent. External evaluation acts through certainty, and requires interaction with human users that express both opinions and some subjective quantitative evaluations on the final artwork. The system uses natural language processing techniques in order to infer the satisfaction and the emotional impact of the final product obtained by the creative agent.},
