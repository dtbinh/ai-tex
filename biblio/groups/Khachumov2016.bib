abstract = {The problem of modeling of the group of pursuers and a running away collective behavior on plane in a perturbed environment has been solved. As objects we assume the unmanned flight vehicles (FVs), which mathematical models are determined by transfer functions that describe the control system with autopilot. Heuristic behavior strategies of all participants of the scene when the speed of running away is higher than the speed of the pursuers are suggested. Situations with different pursuit task solutions' outcomes are modelled in the experimental part of the article.},
