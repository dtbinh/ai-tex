abstract = {Cognitive architectures may serve as a good basis for building mind/brain-inspired, psychologically realistic cognitive agents for various applications that require or prefer human-like behaviour and performance. This article explores a well-established cognitive architecture CLARION and shows how its behaviour and performance capture human psychology at a detailed level. The model captures many psychological quasi-laws concerning categorisation, induction, uncertain reasoning, decision-making, and so on, which indicates human-like characteristics beyond what other models have been shown to be capable of. Thus, CLARION constitutes an advance in developing more psychologically realistic cognitive agents. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},
