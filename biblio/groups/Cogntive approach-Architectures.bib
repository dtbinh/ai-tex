abstract = {Cognitive architectures may serve as a good basis for building mind/brain-inspired, psychologically realistic cognitive agents for various applications that require or prefer human-like behaviour and performance. This article explores a well-established cognitive architecture CLARION and shows how its behaviour and performance capture human psychology at a detailed level. The model captures many psychological quasi-laws concerning categorisation, induction, uncertain reasoning, decision-making, and so on, which indicates human-like characteristics beyond what other models have been shown to be capable of. Thus, CLARION constitutes an advance in developing more psychologically realistic cognitive agents. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {This survey paper discusses the topic of autonomous learning in psychologically-oriented cognitive architectures and reviews some of the most popular cognitive architectures used in psychology, namely ACT-R, Soar, and Clarion. Autonomous learning is critical in the development of cognitive agents, and several learning-related desiderata useful for 'psychological' cognitive architectures are proposed. This article shows that all the reviewed cognitive architectures include some form of explicit ('symbolic') and implicit ('subsymbolic') learning. Additionally, ACT-R and Clarion are shown to include a top-down learning algorithm (from explicit to implicit), and Clarion also includes a bottom-up learning process (from implicit to explicit). Two simulation examples are presented with each cognitive architecture to illustrate the autonomous learning capacities of each modeling paradigm. While Clarion is more autonomous (requiring less a priori knowledge), Soar and ACT-R have so far been used in more complex tasks. The presentation concludes with some general considerations for future work. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most accounts of human cognitive architectures have focused on computational accounts of cognition while making little contact with the study of anatomical structures and physiological processes. Arenewed convergence between neurobiology and cognition is well under way. A promising area arises from the overlap between systems/cognitive neuroscience on the one side and the discipline of network science on the other. Neuroscience increasingly adopts network tools and concepts to describe the operation of collections of brain regions. Beyond just providing illustrative metaphors, network science offers a theoretical framework for approaching brain structure and function as a multi-scale system composed of networks of neurons, cir- cuits, nuclei, cortical areas, and systems of areas. This paper views large-scale networks at the level of areas and systems, mostly on the basis of data from human neuroimaging, and how this view of network structure and function has begun to illuminate our understanding of the biological basis of cognitive architectures.},

abstract = {Robots controlled by the state of the art cognitive architectures are still far behind animals in their capabilities to learn complex skills and autonomously adapt to unexpected circumstances. The neurocognitive architecture proposed in this paper addresses the problem of learning and execution of hierarchical behaviors and complex skills. Learning is addressed both on the level of individual elementary behaviors and goal-directed sequences of actions. The proposed architecture comprises a Dynamic Neural Fields (DNFs) implementation of the low-level elementary behaviors and a Functional System Network (FSN) tying these behaviors in goal-directed sequences. The DNF framework enables a continuous, dynamical representation of perceptual features and motor parameters, which may be directly coupled to the robot's sensors and motors. Attractor states and instabilities of the DNFs account for segregation of cognitive states and mark behaviorally relevant events in the continuous flow of sensorimotor dynamics. The FSN, in its turn, comprises dynamical elements that can be arranged in a multilayered network by a learning process, in which new layers and elementary behaviors are added on demand. In our architecture, the FSN controls adaptation processes in the already acquired neural-dynamic elementary behaviors, as well as formation of new elementary behaviors. Combination of the DNF and FSN frameworks in a neurocognitive architecture NARLE enables pervasive learning both on the level of individual behaviors and goal-directed sequence, contributing to the progress towards more adaptive intelligent robotic systems, capable to learn new tasks and extend their behavioral repertoire in stochastic real-world environments.},

abstract = {Abstract This article represents an extension of authors' previous papers (Chernavskaya, Chernavskii, Karp, Nikitin, {\&} Shchepetov, 2012, 2013) in modeling cognitive systems on the base of the Dynamical Theory of Information. The paper focuses on the problem of account for emotions in artificial system. The main hypothesis consists in the assumption that emotions inherent in a living system could be simulated by variation of amplitude of the occasional component (noise) inherently embedded into the architecture of artificial system. Within this concept, increasing noise amplitude should correspond to negative emotions (anxiety), while its decreasing provides positive emotions (relaxation, pleasure). A rapid up-and-down spike in the noise amplitude could imitate a laugh. This hypothesis is secured by incorporation of an additional dynamical variable that represents an analogy to the compound of neural mediators in human beings. The system of linked equations in terms of “noise amplitude – neurotransmitter compound” is proposed to describe mutual influence of the cognitive process and emotional component. The model permits to reproduce qualitatively certain prominent effects typical for human emotional reactions (like stress and shock).},

abstract = {The representation paradigm used by a cognitive architecture helps to determine the kind of processes that it can perform more efficiently. Vector LIDA is a variation of the LIDA cognitive architecture that employs high-dimensional Modular Composite Representation (MCR) vectors as its main representation model and Integer Sparse Distributed Memory as its main memory implementation technology. The advantages of this new model include a more realistic and biologically plausible model, better integration with its episodic memory, better integration with other low level perceptual processing (such as deep learning systems), better scalability, and easier learning mechanisms. Here, after briefly recapping the LIDA model and MCR, we describe Vector LIDA and argue for its several advantages.},

@article{Chernavskaya2013,
abstract = {The problem of the thinking process modeling is considered within the context of Dynamical Theory of Information. The proposed definition for thinking process is based on listing its main goals and functions. A set of various type neural processors is considered to reveal necessary and sufficient combination to implement these basic functions. It is shown that, according to DTI, the artificial thinking system is to be divided into two subsystems, where the first subsystem provides generation of information and learning, the second one - storage and application of the information. This correlates with presence of two hemispheres of the human brain, one of them is believed to produce the intuition, while the other one being responsible for the logical thinking. A particular version of the thinking-system architecture is proposed. It is shown that in the course of evolution, the system is progressively growing from low imaginary information levels, through semantic levels (where the information has sense for this individual system only), up to high abstract levels that could be verbalized to be generally realized. An interpretation of intuitive and logical thinking is given. Our approach, being close to that common for BICA, does differ in certain points. We are not dealing with the active agents that are a priori endowed with emotions, motivations, and comprehension. Instead, starting with just formal (but dynamical) neurons, the system itself, due to the self-organizing nonlinear interactions of the neuron ensembles, could produce semantic and abstract information, and perceive the verbalized one. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.
