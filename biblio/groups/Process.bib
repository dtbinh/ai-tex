abstract = {This paper shows a formal model of cognitive function of decision-making. The decision-making is only one of several cognitive functions of high level of natural intelligence. Our model has been inspired by human decision-making process. In order to show a comprehensive and coherent model of human decision-making process based on a rigorous formalism, we have adopted a multidisciplinary approach encompassing knowledge in cognitive informatics, neuroscience, and psychology. The model has been divided into conceptual, formal, and computational model. However, in this paper we show the conceptual and part of the formal model. In order to develop a comprehensive and coherent conceptual model of the decision- making process and its relationship with others cognitive processes, we have adopted the layered reference model postulated by Wang. Our conceptual model shows the main brain areas involved in the decision-making process and describes their functions. While our formal model tries to show a rigorous explanation for the cognitive decision-making process.},
