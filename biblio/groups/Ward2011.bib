abstract = {I propose that primary conscious awareness arises from synchronized activity in dendrites of neurons in dorsal thalamic nuclei, mediated particularly by inhibitory interactions with thalamic reticular neurons. In support, I offer four evidential pillars: (1) consciousness is restricted to the results of cortical computations; (2) thalamus is the common locus of action of brain injury in vegetative state and of general anesthetics; (3) the anatomy and physiology of the thalamus imply a central role in consciousness; (4) neural synchronization is a neural correlate of consciousness.},
