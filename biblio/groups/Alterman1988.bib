abstract = {Adaptive Planning is an approach to planning in the cammansense domain. An adaptive planner takes advantage of the habitual nature of many of the planning situations for which tt plans by basing its activities on a memory of pre-stored plans. A critical issue, and the subject of this paper, is the question of flexibility: How does an adaptive plonner refit an old plan in order to meet the demands of some new planning situation? An adaptive planner refits prestored plans by constructing on interpretation of the situation in which it is engaged. Key elements in the theory of adoptive planning are its treatment of specific plans and o notion of situation matching. The theory of adaptive planning has been modeled by a computer program called PLEXUS.},
