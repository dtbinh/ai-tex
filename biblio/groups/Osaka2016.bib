abstract = {â€˜Working memory' refers to the capacity-constrained active memory in which information is temporarily maintained and concurrently processed for the use in an ongoing goal-directed activity. The neural mechanisms responsible for con- sciousness are located in certain brain regions, such as the DLPFC, PPC TPJ and ACC, and these brain regions are coupled with a network that includes the central executive of working memory. In this chapter, we explore the nature of the neural basis of working memory and try to explain the mechanisms of working memory. In order to understand the neural basis of active consciousness, we also investigate how information is controlled by the neural basis of working memory. We use reading span test (RST), which measures the working memory capacity to memo- rize the target words of sentences during reading, to measure individual differences in working memory capacity.},
