abstract = {Highlights:  Computational role of transient network states  Simultaneous recordings from many neurons constrain computational models  Stochastic state transitions point to Markov chain computations  Ongoing network rewiring and compensation through synaptic sampling Abstract Experimental methods in neuroscience, such as Ca-imaging and recordings with multi-electrode arrays, are advancing at a rapid pace. They produce insight into the activity of large numbers of neurons and plastity processes in the brains of awake and behaving animals. These data provide new constraints for modelling neural computations and learning processes that underlie perception, cognition, and behaviour. I will discuss in this short review four such constraints: Inherent recurrent network activity and heterogeneous dynamic properties of neurons and synapses, stereotypical spatio-temporal activity patterns, high trial-to-trial variability of network responses, and functional stability in spite of permanently ongoing changes in the network. I will explain that these constraints provide hints to underlying principles of brain computation and learning. Constraint/Principle 1: Neural circuits are highly recurrent networks of neurons and synapses with diverse dynamic properties},
